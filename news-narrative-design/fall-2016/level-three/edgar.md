 > JUVENILE JUSTICE Revenues.  Revenues derived from juvenile justice programs increased \$4,081,000, or 15.2%, to \$30,864,000 for the six months ended December 31, 1996 from \$26,783,000 for the six months ended December 31, 1995.  The increase resulted primarily from the expansion of juvenile justice programs existing at December 31, 1995 which generated an increase of  \$2,991,000 and the addition of two new juvenile justice programs subsequent to December 31, 1995 which provided additional revenues of  \$1,090,000.  The average daily enrollment for all of the Company's residential juvenile justice programs increased 18.9% to 1,495 youth for the six months ended December 31, 1996 from 1,257 youth for the six months ended December 31, 1995, including a 13.9% increase in average daily enrollment in the nine programs that the Company operated during both six month periods ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 to 1,432 from 1,257, respectively. The Company reported an average occupancy rate of 93.4% for the six months ended December 31, 1996 compared to 94.9% for the six months ended December 31, 1995 based on an average daily licensed capacity of 1,600 beds for 1996 and 1,324 beds for 1995.  The decrease in occupancy percentage is due primarily to the fact that the two new juvenile justice facilities were in various stages of development where maximum occupancy had not yet been reached.
