    "[Various surveys](http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys.html) conducted on differing timelines. Results can be combined for some but not others. The short version:\n",
    "* Decennial Census - Counts every American possible every 10 years as mandated by the constitution\n",
    "* American Community Survey - Smaller sample size, more detailed questions on a yearly basis (roughly 2 million households responded in 2014)\n",

    "* [Poverty Status](http://www.census.gov/did/www/saipe/index.html)\n",
    " * [Thresholds are selected by the Census](http://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html) and [may not include the cost of significant household expenditures](http://www.nyc.gov/html/ceo/downloads/pdf/ceo_poverty_measure_2005_2012.pdf).\n",

    " * Different surveys ask [different questions](https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/laborfor/laborguidance092209.html) which can [influence the percentage of people considered in active labor force pool](http://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm#nilf) \n",

    "\n",
    "Census data released this September showed considerable gains in household income, reduction in poverty and an increase in full-time employment \n",
    "\n",
    "[The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/upshot/the-economic-expansion-is-helping-the-middle-class-finally.html)\n",
    "> The most decisive evidence of improving fortunes is found in new census data released Tuesday showing that median household income rose a whopping 5.2 percent in 2015, to around \\$56,500. According to that data, incomes rose for black families, white families, Hispanic families and Asian-American families. It rose for young people and in households headed by middle-aged adults and older people. In short, the improvement was across the board to a remarkable degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "[The Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/rising-incomes-juice-consumer-spending-1473798203)\n",
    "> John Shin and Michelle Meyer of Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimate that roughly 60% of U.S. households spend all of their income. For most of these people additional income translates into additional spending. That is a one reason the consumer has been the biggest thing the U.S. economy has had going for it lately. \n",

    "<img src='measuring-inequality-census/nyt-interval-inequality.png'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### How are the gains distributed?\n",
    "\n",
    "The recent Census report says nothing about how earnings are changing for households in different income brackets. [Other tables](http://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income/data/tables.html) will describe this but we want to view how incomes are distributed so we need to look at tables with data grouped into [quintiles](http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_15_1YR_B19081&prodType=table).\n",
    "\n",
